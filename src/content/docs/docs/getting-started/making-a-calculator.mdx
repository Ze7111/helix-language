## Building a Basic Calculator in Helix

This tutorial walks you through building a calculator in Helix. The calculator performs arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Along the way, you'll explore:

- Defining and using functions
- Handling `int?` (questionable types)
- Error management with `panic`
- Input and control flow with `match`

---

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project

#### Create a Project Directory
1. Open your terminal and create a directory for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir basic_calculator
   cd basic_calculator
   ```

2. Create a file named `calculator.hlx` for your code:
<Tabs syncKey="operating-platform">
    <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```powershell
        echo. > calculator.hlx
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Unix">
        ```sh
        touch calculator.hlx
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Step 2: Writing the Code

#### Define Arithmetic Functions

Start by defining four functions to handle the arithmetic operations:

```helix
import std::error;

fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b;

fn subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a - b;

fn multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b;

// performs division and panics if dividing by zero.
fn divide(a: int, b: int) -> int? {
    if b == 0:
        panic error::ParseError("Division by zero");

    return a / b;
}
```

#### Implement the Main Function

The `main` function manages input/output and processes operations:

```helix
fn main() {
    let operation: string;
    let result:    int?;
    let x:         int?;
    let y:         int?;

    operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ");
    x = input("Enter the first number: ")  as int?;
    y = input("Enter the second number: ") as int?;

    // validate inputs
    if !(x?) {
        print("Invalid input. Defaulting to 0.");
        x = 0;
    }

    if !(y?) {
        print("Invalid input. Defaulting to 0.");
        y = 0;
    }

    // match operation and calculate
    result = match operation {
        "+" -> add(x, y);
        "-" -> subtract(x, y);
        "*" -> multiply(x, y);
        "/" -> divide(x, y);
        _   -> {
            print(f"Invalid operation: {operation}");
            return null;
        }
    };

    // handle and display results
    if result? {
        print(f"Result: {result}");
    } else if result has error::ParseError {
        print("Error: Division by zero");
    } else {
        print("Error: Invalid operation");
    }
}
```

#### Code Features

1. **Handling Questionable Types (`int?`)**:
   - `x` and `y` are declared as `int?` since they are directly cast from user input, which could result in an error or `null`.
   - `...?` checks if a value exists, while `has ...` detects specific errors like `ParseError` similar to `try` and `catch`.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Division by zero is prevented in `divide` using a `panic`, which raises a `ParseError` if triggered.
   - Invalid operations are caught in the `match` block and handled gracefully.

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Invalid numeric inputs are detected with `!(...?)`, since `...?` returns `true` if theres a value and `false` if it's `null` or an error.

4. **Control Flow**:
   - The `match` statement determines the operation to perform based on user input.

### Step 3: Compiling and Running the Program

#### Compile the Program
Use the Helix compiler to compile your code:
```bash
helix calculator.hlx # automatically generates the binary `calculator`
```

#### Run the Program
After compiling, execute the program:
<Tabs syncKey="operating-platform">
    <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```powershell
        .\calculator.exe
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Unix">
        ```sh
        ./calculator
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Test the Program
Try various inputs to test functionality. Example:
```
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): /
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 0
Error: Division by zero
```

---

### Code Breakdown

#### Functions
- **Arithmetic Functions**: Provide clean, reusable logic for basic operations.
- **Error Management**: The `divide` function handles invalid inputs using `panic` and questionable types (`int?`).

#### Main Function
- **Input Validation**: Ensures user input is processed safely, falling back to defaults when necessary.
- **Control Flow**: Uses `match` to map operations to their respective functions.
- **Error Reporting**: Differentiates between invalid operations and division by zero.

### Enhancements and Next Steps

Expand your calculator with additional features:
- **More Operations**: Add modulus (`%`) or power functions (`x^y`).
- **Chained Operations**: Support expressions like `1 + 2 * 3`.
- **Advanced Input Validation**: Provide better feedback for invalid input.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've built a working calculator in Helix, mastering:
- Functions and control flow
- Error handling with `panic` and `int?`
- Input validation and user interaction
