Welcome to Helix, an advanced programming language designed for high performance and seamless interoperability with C++, Rust, and Python. Helix bridges the gap between low-level control and high-level ergonomics, enabling developers to write fast, reliable, and maintainable software without compromise.

## Who Helix Is For

Helix is suitable for a wide range of developers and organizations. Let's explore some of the key groups that benefit from using Helix.

### Teams of Developers

Helix is an excellent tool for teams of developers with varying levels of experience in systems programming. Low-level code often harbors subtle bugs that are hard to catch without extensive testing and code reviews. Helix's robust compiler and a focus on high-level code that can interact with the lowest level of hardware, catches many of these bugs at compile time, including concurrency issues, allowing developers to focus on logic and functionality rather than bug hunting.

Helix also offers modern developer tools:

- **Helix Package Manager (Helios)**: Simplifies dependency management and builds processes, ensuring consistency across projects.
- **Helix Analyzer**: Provides IDE integration for code completion and inline error messages, enhancing productivity.

By leveraging these tools, teams can efficiently develop complex systems-level code.

### Students

Helix is an excellent choice for students and those new to systems programming or want a unified language that can solve most tasks. It serves as an educational tool for learning about operating systems, compilers, and other low-level concepts while offering higher level access. The Helix community is welcoming and supportive, offering resources and guidance to learners.

Helix's ability to interoperate with C++, Rust, and Python makes it a versatile tool for diverse a codebase.

### Open Source Developers

Helix is for developers who want to contribute to the language, its ecosystem, and its community. Contributions to the Helix language, libraries, and tools are always welcome.

### Performance Enthusiasts

Helix is designed for those who demand speed and stability. It offers both high execution speed and rapid development cycles. The Helix compiler ensures stability through rigorous checks, making code refactoring safe and efficient. Helix strives to achieve zero-cost abstractions, where high-level features compile down to low-level code without performance penalties.

Helix aims to serve many other users as well, not just those mentioned here. Its goal is to eliminate the trade-offs traditionally accepted in programming by offering safety, productivity, speed, and ergonomics.
